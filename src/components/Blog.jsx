                <p className='fs-5'>
                    When you use form in react.  We can use either control component or uncontrolled component.
                    In uncontrolled component you can get the value of input field by accessing their reference.
                    In controlled component you can store value in react state rather than usimg input reference.

                <h3>Q. How to validate React props using PropTypes</h3>
                <p className='fs-5'>
                    React PropTypes is a way to catching bugs by validating data types when you pass props one component to another component.
                    We can install PropTypes by : npm install prop-types.
                    For validate props use Component.Proptypes and props.dataName.PropTypes.data-types,
                    So that you can get exact data-types in your props. If the datatypes not matched then it shows error in console.

                <h3>Q. What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?</h3>
                <p className='fs-5'>
                    Hooks are reusable function. We can add our own functionality hook by custom hook. We should start name of custom hook 'use'. We use custom hook when need to add same logic in multiple components, we can share same logic multiple components using custom hook.
